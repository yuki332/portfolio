        <!-- personal introduction -->
        I'm Yuki Arai and I turned 27 years old in Novemver. I was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan but moved here to Utah when I was 18 years old for schooling by myself. I love programming and designing so much, so I chose to take Digital Media Web and App Development Degree. I'm always trying to learn new things and I love doing that. I went on mission for LDS church 2013 - 2015. I took some classes before the mission, so DGM 2740 final project is missing but I got B- on that class. For the sake of Web and App Development Portfolio, I created this site for Extra Curricular Work Example. I did both designing and coding.
